# Discourse Gifs Theme Component - but with a preferance for Spider-Man

This theme component takes the great functionality of the official Discourse Gifs Theme Component, but injects the phrase "spider-man" into all tenor queries. 

It also will only display the GIF button on topics that have a specific tag: default is "spider-man". 

# If your site does not have tags, this plugin will crash the post composer

This plugin will disrupt the original Discourse Gif's Theme Component.
